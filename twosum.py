# This is my first attempt. Aka the "bubble sort" type method.
# Not efficient to say the least, but it was my first attempt.
# My logic can be broken down into these steps:
# 1. Pick the first item from the list/array.
# 2. Save its index somewhere
# 3. Start looping through the array and checking the next item's value.
#       If we only need two numbers to sum to the target, then basic arithmetic tells us that
#       the target - value 1 = value 2.
#       So we continue looping through the array and ask if target - the first item = second item.
# 4. if target - the first item = second item, then we know that is the answer so we save that index.
# 6. Then we simply add index 1 and index 2 to a list, and return that list as the final answer
# 7. If we have gone through all the values and that if statement is not triggered, then the first value is clearly not
#        one of them. So we move on to the next value, and make THAT the first value (and save the new index for it)
# 8. Rinse and repeat until eventually we get a match

# ChatGPT said the following:
# .index(value) always returns the first occurrence of a number, causing incorrect index lookups.
# You're not checking first_index != second_index, meaning it includes duplicate pairs in different orders.
# This works fine when numbers are unique.
# ‚ùå But if you have duplicates ([3, 3, 4]), nums.index(3) will always return 0, never 1.
#
# üìå Fix: Use enumerate(nums) to track both the index and the value properly.
# Also I had the return final_answer outside of the loop, which was a mistake bc I got duplicate additions

#Version 1.1 -- fixes the issues I had that Chat GPT pointed out.
# This design is different because of several reasons:
# 1. it doesn't save the variables anywhere, it just uses the memory of the loop

# Alternate way a youtuber did it. This is the manual way of using the enumerate function by using range(len(nums)).
# ("The first loop stores all values and their indices in a dictionary. The second loop checks for complements and "
#  "ensures they are not the same index before returning the answer.")
# he('s basically using the range function to create indexes from the nums list, and then just taking the value of i '
#   'directly from nums, and then adding both to the empty dictioanry?)
# range(len(nums)) generates numbers from 0 to len(nums) - 1 (i.e., all valid indices).
# i takes on each of these index values during the loop.
# nums[i] retrieves the actual number at that index.
